		Improved Integration of In Situ Data with Remote Sensing Imagery For Snow Water Equivalent Estimation
		</b>
		<div class="container">
			<p style="padding-top: 25px;">
			Hello, my name is Jeffrey Welch, and I am currently in the Geography MSc. Program at the University of Waterloo. 
			I did my undergrad in geomatics, also at UW. In my time at UW, I developed an interest in climate research and remote sensing. 
			During my work terms, I gained experience in both of those fields through my time at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), 
			in the Atmospheric Monitoring Directorate and the Earth Observation and Geomatics group, respectively. Ultimately, I would like to 
			combine those two areas of study in my future research.

		For the duration of my master’s program, I will be working for Dr. Richard Kelly, as my supervisor, in the 
		<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/rejkelly"> Theoretical and Applied Earth Observation Science Lab (TAEOS) </a>. I initial chose to apply to the UW grad program because of the relationships I developed during 
		my undergrad, specifically with the professors of my remote sensing courses. The focus of the TAEOS group intersects well with my own 
		research interests and the connections I made at ECCC. I hope for my research to provide practical contributions to real-world issues, 
		and I believe understanding and characterising climate change could not be any more relevant.
		</p>
		<p>
		For my thesis, I will attempt to improve the integration of weather station data with remote sensing estimates of snow water equivalent 
		(SWE). Passive microwave remote sensing is suitable for global, synoptic SWE estimation [1], but becomes less accurate with high SWE values 
		and over complex land cover types [2,3]. To better constrain uncertainty in SWE estimates, passive microwave imagery can be combined with 
		in situ observations [4]. The method I will be using is based on the European Space Agency’s <a href="https://www.globsnow.info/">GlobSnow project</a> [5]. By reducing the 
		uncertainty in such a product, uncertainty in the climate data record could be reduced.

			My research will focus on the spatial interpolation of the in situ data aspect of the SWE estimation process. The GlobSnow method uses 
			Ordinary Kriging to interpolate the discrete weather observations, which assumes a constant mean across the entire domain. As that domain 
			covers entire continents, it is unlike that snowpack characteristics are constant across such a large area and Ordinary Kriging may not be 
			the optimal approach. Therefore, I hope to identify a better approach to interpolate weather observations and reduce uncertainty in the 
			final SWE estimates.

		A reduced uncertainty in trends of snowpack characteristics aligns well with the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13"> United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 13 - 
		Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts </a>. In order to properly address climate change, it first must be properly 
		understood and quantified. Snowpack characteristics are an important aspect of characterising climate change, namely SWE, and are used 
		in climate, hydrology, and energy modelling.
